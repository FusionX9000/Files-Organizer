# Files_Organizer
Automates files categorization and tagging with AHK and Python

Initial rough draft. To modify for personal use, change the hotkeys and their sel_msg variable. The categories are hotkeys are shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+HOTKEY and tag hotkeys are CTRL+HOTKEY.
Also, change the value equivalent to WinGetTitle in line 35 to the folder where you want these hotkeys to work. If the use-case is for any global folder, remove WinGetTitle altogether.

To be added : Hotkey to move the files
